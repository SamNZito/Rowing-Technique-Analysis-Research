Introduction
Rowing is a sport that demands precision, strength, and endurance, with technique playing a crucial role in optimizing performance and minimizing injury risk. The complex biomechanics involved in rowing require athletes to maintain proper form throughout each stroke, a task that can be challenging even for experienced rowers. Traditional coaching methods, while effective, often rely on the coach’s observational skills, which can be subjective and limited by human perception. Additionally, these methods are time-consuming and may not provide the real-time feedback necessary for immediate correction during training sessions.
The motivation for this research stems from the growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to sports performance analysis, particularly in disciplines where technique is a significant determinant of success. In rowing, even minor inefficiencies in technique can lead to significant losses in speed and increase the risk of overuse injuries. By leveraging AI and computer vision technologies, it is possible to develop a system that not only provides objective and consistent technique assessments but also offers real-time feedback that can be immediately acted upon by the rower.
This research addresses the problem of developing an AI system capable of analyzing rowing techniques using video footage. The primary goal is to provide rowers and coaches with real-time feedback on form, posture, stroke efficiency, and injury prevention. The secondary goal is to identify deviations from ideal technique and suggest corrective actions, thereby enhancing the training process and potentially reducing the incidence of technique-related injuries. According to studies such as "ARrow: A Real-Time AR Rowing Coach" and "Inaccurate Action Detection Algorithm for Rowing Machine Exercise Based on Attention-CNN," AI has already demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting and correcting improper techniques in rowing, making it a promising tool for further development.
Moreover, the application of AI in sports is becoming increasingly widespread, with systems like the one described in "Intelligent Recognition System of Sports Athletes’ Wrong Actions Based on AI+IoT" proving that AI can be effectively used to analyze and enhance athletic performance across various sports. Given the importance of technique in rowing, a sport where even minor deviations can impact speed and efficiency, the development of an AI system tailored to this sport is both timely and crucial.
The problem can be formulated as a search problem in the context of AI, where the goal is to identify and correct suboptimal rowing techniques using video data. The initial state is represented by the raw, unprocessed video footage of a rower during training. The goal state is achieving optimal technique, as defined by biomechanical standards and expert coaching guidelines. Actions involve analyzing the video to detect deviations from optimal technique, suggesting corrections, and providing feedback. The transition model maps changes in rowing technique as feedback is implemented and the rower adjusts their form. The goal test evaluates whether the rower's technique meets the defined standards, while the path cost could be associated with the time taken or the number of adjustments needed to achieve optimal technique.
In conclusion, this research aims to bridge the gap between traditional rowing coaching and modern AI-driven performance analysis. By developing a system that analyzes rowing technique through video footage, this project seeks to enhance the accuracy, accessibility, and effectiveness of technique training in rowing, potentially setting a new standard in sports coaching and performance enhancement.
